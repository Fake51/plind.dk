I've decided to try moving my career more in the direction of freelancing consulting. It's party based on necessity (haven't found a full-time job yet) and partly on want (consulting/freelancing is very interesting). First step has been to make some info available about it - currently only in Danish but I'll get it up in English soon as well.

The information about me as a consultant is available from the [Freelance Webudvikling](http://plind.dk/freelance-webudvikling/) page. There's some stuff about what I do, what I have worked on and what I charge. Hopefully, there should also soon be my Danish CVR number. That's right: I've started my own company as well, PL PHP!
