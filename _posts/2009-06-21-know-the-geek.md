I have a theory that you can tell a geek by the comics he reads. I don't know yet what the individual geek types are, but some day I'll figure that one out too. In the meantime, the question becomes one of "separate the geeks from the non-geeks by looking at their comic reads". Here are mine:

* [Sinfest](http://www.sinfest.net)
* [Kevin and Kell](http://kevinandkell.com/)
* [Calvin and Hobbes](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/)
* [Non Sequitur](http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur)
* [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html)
* [Garfield minus Garfield](http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/)
* [Too Much Coffee Man](http://tmcm.com/)
* [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com/)

Hmmm ... maybe the length of the list plays a role too ...
