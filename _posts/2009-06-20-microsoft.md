Couldn't help but comment on this:

[Microsoft browser comparison chart](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/get-the-facts/browser-comparison.aspx)

We're told that

> Internet Explorer 8 takes the cake with better phishing and malware protection, as well as protection from emerging threats.

Did Microsoft miss the point about Chrome running every tab as a new process, nicely sandboxed? When you defeat IE, you get ACCESS. If you manage to defeat Chrome, you don't.

Furthermore:

> Internet Explorer 8 has the most comprehensive developer tools built in, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript editing, but also JavaScript profiling; other browsers have developer tools available, but either require you to download them separately, or aren't as complete.

True, you do have to download FireBug to get it working FF. But Safari and Opera come with pretty good dev support too and my money is on both of those as being quite a bit better than what MS has to offer.

Strangely, MS thinks support for web standards is a tie:

> Firefox and Chrome have more support for emerging standards like HTML5 and CSS3, but Internet Explorer 8 invested heavily in having world-class, consistent support for the entire CSS2.1 specification.

Too little too late: CSS2.1 is no longer the frontier, everyone else has been supporting it for long. The [Third Acid Test](http://acid3.acidtests.org/) is a nice example of that. Sure, FF doesn't get a 100% on that but IE8 comes in at 20%!

It's not that I'm unhappy  about the work being done on IE8 - it's just that IE is not there yet. And MS is still trying hard, to ruin the experience of the common user + developer by introducing strange and meaningless changes to the standards of the 'net (two references: [introducing version targetting in IE8](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/theyshootbrowsers/) and breaking JavaScript from the get go), so why be anything but cynical?
