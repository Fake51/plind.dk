I've taken a bite of the bitter apple and realised that I'm not going to get site back up anytime soon - that is, I'm not going to get the custom framework based site up and running. I'm also not going to get a Zend-based site up and running soon though I'm close to switching priorities to that. At some point I'll still do it, I think, just don't have the time at the moment (and no, I don't think I can do a better job, I don't think I can create a superior CMS, but creating my first blog was how I learned about N-to-N database relationships ... without having read about them first. Yes, it's all about learning).

Still need an outlet for ranting, though ... too many things that just don't make sense for me to not comment on them. Hence: @ fake's
